# A rails app

Don't forget to run `bundle install`

You can create a user, edit informations and see all users.
You cannot login !

I generated this app using Le Wagon Template to jumpstart a project.
It include postgresql, bootstrap, jquery, nokogiri, simple_form and a lot more.

## You can check The Form App on Heroku!!
